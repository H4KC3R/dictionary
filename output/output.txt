Abstract: Atmospheric drag is an important inﬂuencing factor in precise orbit determination and
the prediction of low-orbit space debris. It has received widespread attention. Currently, calculating
atmospheric drag mainly relies on different atmospheric density models. This experiment was
designed to explore the impact of different atmospheric density models on the orbit prediction of
space debris. In the experiment, satellite laser ranging data published by the ILRS (International
Laser Ranging Service) were used as the basis for the precise orbit determination for space debris.
The prediction error of space debris orbits at different orbital heights using different atmospheric
density models was used as a criterion to evaluate the impact of atmospheric density models on the
determination of space-target orbits. Eight atmospheric density models, DTM78, DTM94, DTM2000,
J71, RJ71, JB2006, MSIS86, and NRLMSISE00, were compared in the experiment. The experimental
results indicated that the DTM2000 atmospheric density model is best for determining and predicting
the orbits of LEO (low-Earth-orbit) targets.
Keywords: atmospheric model; orbit determination; orbit prediction
1. Introduction
Atmospheric drag is an important inﬂuencing factor in determining and predicting the
orbits of low-orbit space debris. Density distribution is a key physical quantity in studies of
the variation laws of satellite motion under the inﬂuence of atmospheric drag. The so-called
atmospheric density model is a mathematical model that calculates atmospheric density
and its changes at corresponding time positions based on relevant parameters [1–4].
At present, some of the most commonly used atmospheric density models for space
debris orbit determination and prediction include the Jacchia series, the Mass Spectrometer
Incoherent Scatter Radar (MSIS) series, the Drag Temperature Model (DTM) series, and so
on [5]. MSIS is an empirical atmospheric density model series that combines approximate
neutral gas particle density, temperature, and solar radiation ﬂux (F10.7) values, and values
describing the geomagnetic activity (Ap) levels. The mathematical model of this mode is
a spherical harmonic suitable for remote observation with multiple satellites [ 6–10]. The
Jacchia model series is an atmospheric model established using satellite orbital decay data,
and a series of other models have been developed based on this foundation, such as Jacchia–
Bowman 2006. The basis for the Jacchia–Bowman 2006 (JB2006) atmospheric density model
is the COSPAR International Reference Atmosphere 72 (CIRA72) atmospheric density
model. The JB2006 model uses a new half-year density equation to replace the old equation
in the Jacchia model series with a new solar index. In addition, several other equation-
modeling methods have been incorporated in the JB2006 model to correct daily variations
in errors [ 11–14]. DTM is a semi-empirical model that describes the temperature, density,
and composition of the Earth’s thermosphere. The earliest DTM model is based on the
Sensors 2023 ,23, 8993. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23218993 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensorsSensors 2023 ,23, 8993 2 of 17
Jacchia model, which more accurately represents the atmospheric density under extreme
solar and geomagnetic conditions compared to the Jacchia model. The DTM model series
is the result of simulation under moderate solar conditions, making it suitable for various
applications [15–17].
There are two main ways to evaluate the performance of the above density modes: ﬁrst,
comparative analysis at the density level; second, analysis of the application level of orbit
prediction [ 18]. Qiu Hongxing analyzed the impact of eight commonly used atmospheric
density models on orbit prediction accuracy using GPS data [ 19]. Liu Wei and others used
GPS data from the Tiangong Space Station to analyze the impact of atmospheric density
models under different geomagnetic and solar radiance intensities on orbit prediction
accuracy [20].
In the application of space target orbit determination, we found that some atmospheric
density models do not seem to be ideal. When using satellite laser ranging data released
by the ILRS [ 21] for orbit determination, some atmospheric density models are unable to
perform orbit determination. In the case of using certain atmospheric models, the process
of iteratively ﬁtting observation data for orbit prediction in orbit determination calculations
does not converge, making it impossible to complete orbit determination calculations.
Therefore, an idea emerged to quantitatively compare the advantages and disadvantages
of different atmospheric density models. Based on previous research [ 22–25], this method
uses satellite laser ranging data published by the ILRS for orbit determination. This
method evaluates the impact of different atmospheric density models on orbit prediction
by using several speciﬁc space targets to represent retired satellites in space debris types.
In contrast to the GPS data mentioned above, the laser ranging data of the experimental
target can be easily obtained from the ofﬁcial website of the ILRS. By comparing orbital
prediction errors, we can study the impact of different atmospheric density models on
orbital prediction accuracy.
2. Basic Methods
We performed the orbit determination of space targets in this experiment using the
following methodology [26,27]:
(1) Obtain measurement data;
(2) Preprocess measurement data to eliminate outliers;
(3) Set parameters for each dynamic model;
(4) Obtain the initial position velocity, and bring it into the mechanical model to obtain
the acceleration for orbit integration calculations;
(5) Obtain orbit prediction at the target time, incorporate observation values, and use
appropriate algorithms for iterative calculations. In this experiment, the least squares
method was applied to calculate the correction using observed data;
(6) Calculate the difference between the position vector obtained from the iteration of the
epoch time and the observation data. Determine whether the difference is less than
the preset convergence limit, and, if it is less, the orbit determination calculation is
completed. It is also possible to determine whether the orbit determination calculation
is completed by iteratively calculating the correction value. If the correction value is
less than the preset convergence limit, the orbit determination calculation is completed.
This experiment uses correction values to determine convergence.
The basic steps for orbit prediction in this experiment are as follows:
(1) Obtain the initial range velocity (IRV). In this experiment, IRV refers to the position
and velocity parameters of the experimental target at the beginning of the prediction;
(2) Bring this IRV into the mechanical model to calculate the acceleration value of targets
at this epoch;
(3) Incorporate the position parameters, velocity parameters, and acceleration values into
the orbit integrator to calculate the position and velocity parameters 30 s afterward.
This experiment uses an Adam Cowell integrator with an integration period of 30 s;Sensors 2023 ,23, 8993 3 of 17
(4) From step 3, we can obtain new position and velocity parameters. Introduce new
positional velocity parameters into the dynamic model to obtain the acceleration
values at the new epoch;
(5) Incorporate the position parameters, velocity parameters, and acceleration values
obtained from step 4 into the orbit integrator to calculate position and velocity param-
eters 30 s afterwards;
(6) Repeat steps 4 and 5 until the target time position is reached.
In the above orbit determination and prediction calculations, atmospheric drag is an
important component of the dynamic model. The atmospheric density is an important
parameter for calculating atmospheric drag; therefore, the atmospheric density model
affects the orbit determination and prediction of space debris in low Earth orbit.
In this way, the errors caused by different atmospheric density models will continue
to accumulate and amplify.
There are currently not many low Earth orbit space debris observations with high-
precision observation data. As one of the sources of space debris, scrapped satellites are
used to represent space debris in this study. Laser ranging data are an important component
of high-precision observation data for space targets. Therefore, this study selected satellite
data publicly released by ILRS as the experimental object. Although the experimental target
has not yet been scrapped, it has the same operational logic as space debris when these
targets do not transfer their orbits. In this experiment, three days of laser ranging data
were used to determine and predict orbits. This ensured that the target to be calculated
had sufﬁcient data points. Some low-orbit targets have limited observation data points,
making it difﬁcult to determine their orbits with daily data. Observation outliers need to
be removed before orbit determination. In this experiment, we used a simpliﬁed dynamic
model (SGP4) for orbit prediction to screen out observation data with errors greater than
the preset limits. Orbit determination calculation is a continuous iterative ﬁtting calculation
that utilizes observation data and orbit prediction results. For low-Earth-orbit satellites, if
the time span of the observation data is too large, the accumulated error in orbit prediction
will be very large. When performing orbit determination iteration calculations, the ﬁtting
calculation results will not converge. If the reference observation data time span is too long,
it will result in a large quantity of valid data being removed as outliers. Therefore, we
ultimately decided to choose three days of observation data. For example, using data from
1 January to 3 January 2015, orbit determination and prediction were carried out to obtain
the space debris prediction velocity and position parameters (P) from 0:00 on 5 January
2015 to 0:00 on 6 January 2015, UTC time. We then compared the orbit prediction results, P ,
with the orbit determination results from January 5th, D, and calculated the ERROR value
(unit: m) as the evaluation value for the different atmospheric density models. The ERROR
equation is as follows:
ERROR =åT48
T24q
(DX PX)2+(DY PY)2+(DZ PZ)2/1441, (1)
In this equation, D is the result of orbit determination, and P is the position parameter
of the orbit prediction. In this experiment, one data point was obtained every minute.
Therefore, there were a total of 1441 data points for orbit prediction from 24 h to 48 h. The
larger the value obtained, the lower the accuracy.
To quantitatively evaluate the impact of different atmospheric density models on the
space debris orbit determination calculation, we propose the following method: extrapolate
the average accuracy of the prediction error from 24 to 48 h, calculated using different
atmospheric density models for target space debris at different altitudes, from high to
low. The scoring method is to rank the prediction errors of different density models in
the same time period from small to large. Because this article considers a total of eight
models, the score is inversely proportional to the error ranking with a score from 8 to
1. The highest score is 8 points, and the lowest score is 1 point. Thus, by adding up
the accuracy scores of the same target debris and atmospheric densities throughout theSensors 2023 ,23, 8993 4 of 17
year, we can obtain emission scores ranging from high to low for different orbital altitude
and atmospheric density models. Based on this series of scoring results, a quantitative
evaluation can be performed based on the impact of different atmospheric density models
on the orbit determination calculations.
3. Selection of Experimental Data
Taking the DTM atmospheric model as an example, the density of the thermosphere atmo-
sphere at an altitude of 120–1500 km can be calculated using the following equations [16,28]:
fi(z)=T120
T(z)1 +i
exp( i), (2)
(z)=å
ii(120 km )fi(z)exp(Gi(L)) (3)
where T(z)=T¥ (T¥ T120)exp( ).T¥is the outer atmospheric temperature, 
is the diffusion coefﬁcient of He and H, i=mig(120 km )/(kT¥),miis the atomic or
molecular mass of the component, g(120 km )is the gravitational acceleration at 120 km
altitude, is the vertical temperature gradient, k is the Boltzmann constant, is the altitude,
i(120 km )is the density of component i at an altitude of 120 km, and Gi(L)is used to
describe periodic and nonperiodic changes. Periodic changes are deﬁned as annual and
semiannual terms, as well as diurnal, semidiurnal, and terdiurnal terms [16].
The above equations show that the solar radio ﬂux and the geomagnetic index are
important factors affecting the atmospheric density. F10.7 is the solar radiation ﬂux at
a wavelength of 10.7 cm (2800 MHz), which can well describe the radiation level of the
Sun [ 28–35]. Figure 1 shows the time variation of the F10.7 radiation intensity; the data are
from the public data of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [36].

pact of atmospheric drag on the space debris.  
The data volume of these five satellites is relatively sufficient, and their geometric 
shapes are relatively simple. They cover a track altitude ranging from 450 km to 1500 km, 
and their mission time range just covers the solar variation peak in 2015.  The processing 
results of these five satellites can represent the space debris , which is the retired satellites 
with small area-mass ratio s. 
The perturbation force of space debris in low  Earth orbit can be divided into two 
categories: the conservative forces and the non -conservative forces. The conservative 
forces include the gravity of the Earth;  the gravity of the Sun, the Moon, and other celestial 
bodies; the solid tide and ocean tide perturbation; and the relativistic perturbation. The 
non-conservative forces include the atmospheric resistance, the solar light pressure, the 
Earth-shine radiation  pressure, etc. [3 9–41]. The influence of the a tmospheric model ex-
plored on orbit determination in this experiment is a non -conservative force perturbation. 
To control the variables, the same model is used for all other perturbations.  
Figure 1. F10.7 solar radio ﬂux versus time.
Figure 1 shows that the solar ﬂux intensity reached a peak in 2015. The solar intensity
changed dramatically in that year, so we used the 2015 data for this experiment. This
experiment used space debris laser ranging data publicly released by the ILRS as the basis
for orbit determination and prediction. Target selection should strive to cover different
orbital altitudes. Based on the above requirements, the target space debris selected for this
experiment is described in Table 1 based on public data [37,38].Sensors 2023 ,23, 8993 5 of 17

4. Data-Processing Results
The data disclosed by the ILRS included data from multiple satellite laser ranging
stations. Orbit determination and prediction were performed on a single satellite over three
days of multi-station data. We evaluated and calculated the ERROR value according to
the method described in Section 2. Taking the 2015 data processing results of the SpinSat
satellite as an example, the orbit prediction errors of the different atmospheric density
models are described in Table 2.

The orbit altitude of the SpinSat satellite is 425 km. The ﬁrst column in the table is the
time of the root mean square error (RMSE). Next, each column shows the prediction errors
of the different atmospheric density models. The unit of error is in meters. In the table,
“none” represents a failure to successfully determine the orbit using the model.
According to the method described in Section 2 and the prediction error results in
Table 2, the error ranking table obtained is as in Table 3.Sensors 2023 ,23, 8993 8 of 17

By calculating the scores in each column, we determined the advantages and disad-
vantages of the orbital prediction applications for the different atmospheric density models
at a 425 km orbital altitude in 2015.
Table 4 shows the calculation results of the laser ranging data for all of 2015. The
columns represent different atmospheric density models, and each row represents satellites
with different orbital altitudes. Using the 2015 global station laser ranging data for orbit
determination and prediction for different atmospheric density models, Table 4 shows the
quantitative evaluation ranking scores of the atmospheric density models with different
orbital altitudes based on the evaluation method proposed in Section 2. The scores for each
grid in Table 4 are the sum of the corresponding model’s application scores for the orbit
prediction throughout 2015. Taking the corresponding score of the DTM78 column in the
Spinsat row as an example, this score is the sum of all the scores in the DTM78 column in
Table 3.

From Table 4, it is not difﬁcult to see that the different atmospheric density models
have different impacts on the accuracy of orbit determination and prediction for satellites
with different orbital altitudes. The representative accuracy calculation results from the
2015 data are taken and plotted below.
In Figure 2, the vertical axis represents the prediction error of different atmospheric
density models in meters, and the horizontal axis is the time since 00:00 on the ﬁrst day
of observation data in days. Based on the data in Table 4, DTM2000 and RJ71 are more

6. Conclusions
To quantitatively evaluate the impact of different atmospheric density models on the
orbit prediction calculations, we proposed a scoring method based on the extrapolation
accuracy of different atmospheric density models at different orbit altitudes. This method is
based on published space-target laser ranging data, which are used to determine the orbits
of space targets at different orbital altitudes and use different atmospheric density models
for orbit prediction. The prediction accuracies of speciﬁc time periods were ranked and
scored from highest to lowest and then aggregated to obtain a quantitative atmospheric
density model orbit prediction accuracy scoring table.Sensors 2023 ,23, 8993 15 of 17
The results from Tables 4 and 5 show the following:
 The advantages and disadvantages of atmospheric density models vary at different
orbital altitudes. For multi-station laser ranging data, the best-performing atmospheric
density models at an altitude of 425 km are DTM2000 and RJ71; the best-performing at-
mospheric density model at an altitude of 485 km is NRLMSISE00; the best-performing
atmospheric density model at an altitude of 720 km is JB2006; the best-performing at-
mospheric density model at an altitude of 815 km is DTM2000; and the best-performing
atmospheric density model at an altitude of 1490 km is JB2006.
 For single-station laser ranging data from station number 7090, the best-performing
atmospheric density model at an altitude of 485 km is DTM94; the best-performing
atmospheric density model at an altitude of 720 km is JB2006; and the best-performing
atmospheric density model at an altitude of 1490 km is MSIS86.
Summarizing the scores shows that the DTM2000 atmospheric density model is the
best for orbit prediction calculations of low-Earth-orbit space debris, which is retired
satellites with small area–mass ratios. The RJ71 model and the NRLMSISE00 model
followed closely in terms of scores. The difference in scores between these three models
is not very signiﬁcant, and using these three models for low-Earth-orbit prediction error
results will be more stable.
